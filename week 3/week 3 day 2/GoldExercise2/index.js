//Exercise 2 : Mixup
//Instructions
//Create 2 variables. The values should be strings. For example:
//let str1 = "mix";
//let str2 = "pod";
let str1 = "blue";
let str2 = "bird";
console.log(str1);
console.log(str2);
//2. Slice out and swap the first 2 characters of the two strings from part 1.
let result = str1.slice(1, 2);
console.log(result);
let text = str2.slice(3, 4);
console.log(text);

let texts = "Hello world!";
console.log(texts);
let results = text.slice(0, 5);
console.log(results);



//3. Create a third variable where the value is the concatenation of the two strings from the part 1 (separated by a space).


//4. Finally console.log the new concatenated string.



//Some Examples

//let str1 = "mix";
//let str2 = "pod";
//let newWord should be equal to 'pox mid'

//let firstWord = "Hello";
//let secondWord = "World";
//let thirdWord should be equal to 'Wollo Herl
