// Create 2 variables, x and y. Each of them should have a different numeric value.
let x = 6
let y = 3

// Write an if/else statement that checks which number is bigger.

if (x < y) {
    console.log("x is smaller")}
else {
    console.log("y is smaller")
}
// Example :

// let x = 5;
// let y = 2;

let s = 10
let t = 8

if (x > y) {
    console.log("s is the biggest number")}
else {
    console.log("y is the biggest number")
}

// You should display:
// x is the biggest number
